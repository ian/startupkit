description: AI agent instructions file for guiding AI coding assistants in your project
---

StartupKit projects include an `AGENTS.md` file that provides context and guidelines for AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.

## What is AGENTS.md?

The `AGENTS.md` file is a comprehensive guide that helps AI assistants understand your project's architecture, conventions, and best practices. When you work with AI tools, they can reference this file to provide more accurate, context-aware suggestions.

## File Location

The agent instructions are managed in the `.ruler/` directory:

```
my-project/
├── .ruler/
│   └── AGENTS.md           # Source file for AI instructions
├── AGENTS.md               # Generated root file
├── CLAUDE.md               # Claude-specific instructions
└── WARP.md                 # Warp terminal instructions
```

## What's Included

The generated `AGENTS.md` covers:

- **Project Structure** - Workspace layout, package architecture, file locations
- **TypeScript Standards** - Strict configuration, code style rules, naming conventions
- **Package Management** - pnpm commands, dependency catalogs, workspace protocol
- **Database** - Drizzle ORM schema patterns, migration commands
- **UI Components** - Shadcn usage, styling conventions, component imports
- **Authentication** - @repo/auth configuration, client/server usage, route locations
- **Analytics** - PostHog integration, feature flags, tracking
- **Best Practices** - Server Components, environment variables, testing

## Updating Agent Instructions

To customize the AI agent instructions for your project:

1. **Edit the source file**:
   ```bash
   # Modify the main instructions
   code .ruler/AGENTS.md
   ```

2. **Regenerate the output files**:
   ```bash
   pnpm agents.md
   ```

This regenerates `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `WARP.md`, and other AI-specific instruction files at the repository root.

## Using with AI Assistants

Most AI coding assistants automatically detect and use `AGENTS.md`:

| Assistant | Detection |
|-----------|-----------|
| Cursor | Automatically reads AGENTS.md |
| Claude (Anthropic) | Reads CLAUDE.md when available |
| GitHub Copilot | Uses AGENTS.md for context |
| Warp Terminal | Uses WARP.md for commands |

## Customization Tips

### Add Project-Specific Context

Include information specific to your domain:

```markdown
## Business Logic

- Users can have multiple organizations
- Billing is handled through Stripe
- Feature flags control premium features
```

### Document Custom Conventions

If your team has specific patterns:

```markdown
## Our Conventions

- API routes return `{ data, error }` format
- Use `trpc` for type-safe API calls
- All dates are stored in UTC
```

### Include External Service Info

Document integrations:

```markdown
## External Services

- **Stripe**: Handles payments, webhooks at `/api/webhooks/stripe`
- **Resend**: Email delivery via @repo/emails
- **PostHog**: Analytics and feature flags
```

## Ruler Integration

StartupKit uses [Ruler](https://github.com/intellectronica/ruler) to manage AI instructions. Ruler concatenates multiple markdown files into unified instruction sets.

### Adding More Context Files

Create additional files in `.ruler/`:

```
.ruler/
├── AGENTS.md           # Main instructions
├── api-patterns.md     # API conventions
├── testing.md          # Testing guidelines
└── deployment.md       # Deployment docs
```

Then regenerate:

```bash
pnpm agents.md
```

All `.ruler/*.md` files are concatenated into the final output.
