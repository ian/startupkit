StartupKit is an **application accelerator** for AI agents. Built as a Turborepo monorepo, it provides a complete foundation with authentication, analytics, database, and UI components pre-configured—all with clear patterns that AI coding tools can understand and extend.

## The Problem

Building an application from scratch means spending weeks on boilerplate:

- Setting up authentication flows
- Configuring analytics providers
- Building and styling UI components
- Optimizing for SEO
- Managing a monorepo structure
- Wiring up databases and ORMs

By the time you've got the basics working, you've lost momentum and haven't written a single line of product code.

## The Solution

StartupKit gives you everything you need out of the box:

| Feature | What You Get |
|---------|--------------|
| **[Authentication](/docs/auth)** | Email OTP, OAuth providers, session management via [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) |
| **[Analytics](/docs/analytics)** | Provider-agnostic tracking with [PostHog](https://posthog.com/), [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/), [OpenPanel](https://openpanel.dev/) plugins |
| **[Database](/docs/db)** | [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), ready-to-use schemas |
| **[UI Components](/docs/ui)** | Full [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library pre-configured with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) |
| **[Emails](/docs/emails)** | [React Email](https://react.email/) templates with [Resend](https://resend.com/) integration |
| **[SEO](/docs/seo)** | Metadata, sitemaps, robots.txt, structured data utilities |

## Design Principles

### 1. No Lock-in

Every package in StartupKit wraps standard, well-maintained libraries. If you outgrow a component, you can eject and use the underlying library directly:

- Auth → [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)
- Analytics → [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) / [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) / [OpenPanel](https://openpanel.dev/) SDKs
- Database → [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- UI → [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) + [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

### 2. AI-Ready

StartupKit is designed for the AI coding era. Clear patterns, consistent conventions, and well-documented code make it easy for tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude to understand and extend your codebase.

Every project includes an `AGENTS.md` file that explains your codebase structure to AI tools.

### 3. Production-Ready

This isn't a starter template you'll throw away. StartupKit uses the same architecture patterns used by production applications serving millions of users.

## Who Is This For?

StartupKit is ideal for:

- **Solo founders** who want to ship fast without compromising on quality
- **Small teams** who need a shared foundation to build on
- **Developers** who are tired of reinventing the wheel for every project
- **Anyone** building a web application, internal tool, or AI-powered product
