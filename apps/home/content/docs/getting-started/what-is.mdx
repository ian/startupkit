StartupKit is a **meta-framework** for building SaaS applications. It provides a complete foundation with authentication, analytics, database, and UI components pre-configured so you can focus on building your product.

## The Problem

Building a SaaS from scratch means spending weeks on boilerplate:

- Setting up authentication flows
- Configuring analytics providers
- Building and styling UI components
- Optimizing for SEO
- Managing a monorepo structure
- Wiring up databases and ORMs

By the time you've got the basics working, you've lost momentum and haven't written a single line of product code.

## The Solution

StartupKit gives you everything you need out of the box:

| Feature | What You Get |
|---------|--------------|
| **Authentication** | Email OTP, OAuth providers, session management via Better Auth |
| **Analytics** | Provider-agnostic tracking with PostHog, Google Analytics, OpenPanel plugins |
| **Database** | Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL, ready-to-use schemas |
| **UI Components** | Full Shadcn/ui library pre-configured with Tailwind |
| **Emails** | React Email templates with Resend integration |
| **SEO** | Metadata, sitemaps, robots.txt, structured data utilities |
| **Monorepo** | Turborepo with shared configs, packages, and apps |

## Design Principles

### 1. No Lock-in

Every package in StartupKit wraps standard, well-maintained libraries. If you outgrow a component, you can eject and use the underlying library directly:

- Auth → Better Auth
- Analytics → PostHog / GA / OpenPanel SDKs
- Database → Drizzle ORM
- UI → Shadcn/ui + Radix

### 2. AI-Ready

StartupKit is designed for the AI coding era. Clear patterns, consistent conventions, and well-documented code make it easy for tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude to understand and extend your codebase.

Every project includes an `AGENTS.md` file that explains your codebase structure to AI tools.

### 3. Production-Ready

This isn't a starter template you'll throw away. StartupKit uses the same architecture patterns used by production applications serving millions of users.

## Who Is This For?

StartupKit is ideal for:

- **Solo founders** who want to ship fast without compromising on quality
- **Small teams** who need a shared foundation to build on
- **Developers** who are tired of reinventing the wheel for every project
- **Anyone** building a SaaS, internal tool, or web application

## Tech Stack

StartupKit is built on proven technologies:

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **React**: React 19 with Server Components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Components**: Shadcn/ui + Radix primitives
