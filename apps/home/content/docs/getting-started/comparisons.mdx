## When to Use Something Else

StartupKit isn't the right choice for every project:

- **Static sites** → Use Astro or plain Next.js
- **Mobile apps** → Use Expo or React Native directly  
- **E-commerce** → Consider Shopify or Medusa
- **Heavy tRPC usage** → T3 Stack may be better
- **Learning React** → Start with Vite or follow the [React tutorial](https://react.dev/learn)
