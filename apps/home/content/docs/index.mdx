# Welcome to StartupKit

StartupKit is a meta-framework for building SaaS applications. It's built on **Next.js**, **React 19**, **TypeScript**, and **Turbo** with authentication, analytics, database, and UI components pre-configured.

## Why StartupKit?

Building a SaaS from scratch means spending weeks on boilerplate:

- Setting up authentication
- Configuring analytics
- Building UI components
- Optimizing for SEO
- Managing a monorepo

StartupKit gives you all of this out of the box, so you can focus on what matters: **building your product**.

## Quick Start

Get started with a single command:

```bash
npx startupkit init
```

This will:
1. Clone the complete monorepo template
2. Install all dependencies
3. Set up workspace packages

Then start the development server:

```bash
cd my-project
pnpm dev
```

## What's Included

### Packages

StartupKit includes several packages that work together:

- **[@startupkit/analytics](/docs/packages/analytics)** - Provider-agnostic analytics with plugins for PostHog, Google Analytics, OpenPanel, and more
- **[@startupkit/auth](/docs/packages/auth)** - Lightweight authentication wrappers around Better Auth
- **[@startupkit/cli](/docs/packages/cli)** - Command-line tool for scaffolding projects
- **[@startupkit/seo](/docs/packages/seo)** - SEO utilities including metadata, structured data, sitemaps
