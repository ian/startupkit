title: Introduction
description: Welcome to StartupKit - The startup stack for the AI era
---

StartupKit is an application accelerator for AI agents. It's built on **Next.js**, **React 19**, **TypeScript**, and **Turbo** with authentication, analytics, database, and UI components pre-configured—all designed with clear patterns that AI coding tools can understand and extend.

## Why StartupKit?

Building an application from scratch means spending weeks on boilerplate:

- Setting up authentication
- Configuring analytics
- Building UI components
- Optimizing for SEO
- Managing a monorepo

StartupKit gives you all of this out of the box, so you can focus on what matters: **building your product**.

## Quick Start

Get started with a single command:

```bash
npx startupkit init
```

This will:
1. Clone the complete monorepo template
2. Install all dependencies
3. Set up workspace packages

Then start the development server:

```bash
cd my-project
pnpm dev
```

## What's Included

### Packages

StartupKit includes several packages that work together:

- **[@repo/analytics](/docs/analytics)** - Provider-agnostic analytics with plugins for PostHog, Google Analytics, and OpenPanel
- **[@repo/auth](/docs/auth)** - Authentication wrappers built on Better Auth
- **[@repo/db](/docs/db)** - Type-safe database access with Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL
- **[@repo/emails](/docs/emails)** - Transactional emails with React Email and Resend
- **[@repo/seo](/docs/seo)** - SEO utilities including metadata, structured data, and sitemaps
- **[@repo/ui](/docs/ui)** - Pre-built components with Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind

## Architecture

StartupKit uses a **two-layer package architecture** that separates core infrastructure from your customizable code.

### `@startupkit/*` — Core packages

Published npm packages that provide the underlying infrastructure:

```tsx
import { PostHogPlugin, GoogleAnalyticsPlugin } from "@startupkit/analytics"
import { generateMetadata, generateSitemap } from "@startupkit/seo"
```

These packages provide:
- Plugin systems and adapters
- Utility functions
- Type definitions
- Provider integrations

You don't modify these—they're updated via npm.

### `@repo/*` — Your packages

Local workspace packages in your `packages/` directory that you own and customize:

```tsx
import { useAnalytics, AnalyticsProvider } from "@repo/analytics"
import { useAuth, AuthProvider } from "@repo/auth"
import { db, users } from "@repo/db"
import { Button, Card } from "@repo/ui/components/button"
```

These packages:
- Wrap `@startupkit/*` packages with your configuration
- Contain your database schema
- Hold your custom components
- Include project-specific logic

### Why this design?

| Layer | What it provides | Who maintains it |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| `@startupkit/*` | Core infrastructure, plugins, utilities | StartupKit (npm updates) |
| `@repo/*` | Your configuration, schema, customizations | You |

This lets you **receive updates** to core functionality while **keeping full control** over your implementation. When we ship improvements to `@startupkit/analytics`, you get them without losing your custom event types or provider configuration.

See [Project Structure](/docs/getting-started/project-structure) for more details.

## AI-Ready

StartupKit is designed to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants. Clear patterns, consistent conventions, and well-documented code make it easy for tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude to understand and extend your codebase.

Every project includes an `AGENTS.md` file that explains your codebase structure to AI tools.
