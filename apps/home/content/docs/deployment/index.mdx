description: Deploy your StartupKit application to production
---

StartupKit works with any platform that supports Next.js. This guide covers deployment to popular platforms.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| [Vercel](/docs/deployment/vercel) | Easiest setup, great for most projects |
| [Cloudflare](/docs/deployment/cloudflare) | Edge-first, global performance |
| [Railway](/docs/deployment/railway) | Simple infrastructure, good DX |
| [Render](/docs/deployment/render) | Straightforward pricing |
| [Fly.io](/docs/deployment/fly) | Multi-region, container-based |

## Before You Deploy

### 1. Database

You'll need a PostgreSQL database. Recommended providers:

- [Neon](https://neon.tech) — Serverless Postgres, generous free tier
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) — Postgres with extras
- [Railway](https://railway.app) — Simple managed Postgres
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) — MySQL (requires adapter)

### 2. Run Migrations

Before first deployment, push your schema:

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

Or run migrations:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Each platform has its own way of setting environment variables. At minimum, you'll need:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

See [Environment Variables](/docs/getting-started/environment-variables) for the complete list.

## Production Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Database is provisioned and migrated
- [ ] Authentication providers configured with production URLs
- [ ] Analytics is tracking correctly
- [ ] Custom domain configured
- [ ] SSL certificate active

## Monorepo Configuration

For all platforms, you'll need to configure the build for your monorepo:

- **Root Directory**: `apps/web`
- **Build Command**: `pnpm build` (or `turbo run build --filter=web`)
- **Install Command**: `pnpm install`

## Next Steps

Choose your deployment platform:

- [Vercel](/docs/deployment/vercel) — Recommended for most users
- [Cloudflare](/docs/deployment/cloudflare) — Edge deployment
- [Railway](/docs/deployment/railway) — Simple setup
- [Render](/docs/deployment/render) — Predictable pricing
- [Fly.io](/docs/deployment/fly) — Multi-region containers
